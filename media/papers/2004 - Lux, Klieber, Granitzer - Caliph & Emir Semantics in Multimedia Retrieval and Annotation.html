<P><FONT face=Verdana>Applying Information Retrieval methods directly to 
multimedia objects like images, video audio documents or interactive 
presentations, is often not possible without adaptations of existing algorithms. 
Aiming for cross media retrieval, which allows retrieval across different 
formats and media types, a common denominator for different media types and 
formats has to be found. A common approach is the usage of metadata in a way 
that does not differentiate between single media types and formats. For 
multimedia objects one of these already specified metadata schemes is MPEG-7. On 
the one hand MPEG-7 allows low level and technical descriptions like color 
distributions or blockiness of an image. On the other hand manual annotation of 
multimedia objects in different levels, ranging from free text annotations to 
complex computer-readable structured semantic descriptions, is supported. The 
paper we present is twofold. In the first half a current research project 
prototype called "Caliph &amp; Emir" is presented. It allows annotation and 
retrieval of semantic descriptions, created and stored as directed graphs, in 
the context of digital photos. The annotation and retrieval capabilities are 
based on MPEG-7. In addition to semantic descriptions common content based image 
retrieval mechanisms were implemented and widely used metadata formats for 
digital photos like EXIF, Adobe's XMP and IPTC IIM were integrated. Caliph, 
which stands for "Common And Light weight PHoto Annotation", is the annotation 
part supporting graphical annotation and graph visualization. Emir, which is 
short for "Experimental Metadata based Image Retrieval", is the retrieval 
engine. Besides the prototype description the value added by semantic 
descriptions is discussed. The second part gives an outlook on future work. The 
next step in development is merging the retrieval capabilities of "Caliph &amp; 
Emir" with another research project, a cross media retrieval and visualization 
application. We also outline further developments towards cross media 
applications in general and we discuss the integration of existing ontologies 
for semantic annotation and retrieval in combination based on 
MPEG-7.</FONT></P></FONT>
