  abstract = {Tag clouds are text-based visual representations of a set of tags usually depicting tag importance by font size. Recent trends in social and collaborative software have greatly increased the popularity of this type of visualization. This paper proposes a family of novel algorithms for tag cloud layout and presents evaluation results obtained from an extensive user study and a technical evaluation. The algorithms address issues found in many common approaches, for example large whitespaces, overlapping tags and restriction to specific boundaries. The layouts computed by these algorithms are compact and clear, have small whitespaces and may feature arbitrary convex polygons as boundaries. The results of the user study and the technical evaluation enable designers to devise a combination of algorithm and parameters which produces satisfying tag cloud layouts for many application scenarios.},

In this paper, we examine whether user library statistics can pro- duce meaningful results with regards to science evaluation and knowledge domain visualization. We are conducting two empirical studies, using a sample of library data from Mendeley, the world’s largest social reference management system. Based on the occurrence of references in users’ li- braries, we perform a large-scale impact factor analysis and an exploratory co-readership analysis. Our preliminary find- ings indicate that the analysis of user library statistics can produce accurate, timely, and content-rich results. We find that there is a significant relationship between the impact factor and the occurrence of references in libraries. Using a knowledge domain visualization based on co-occurrence measures, we are able to identify two areas of topics within the emerging field of technology-enhanced learning.},

  abstract = {An important aspect of the work of researchers as well as librarians is to manage collections of scientific literature. Social research networks, such as Mendeley and {CiteULike}, provide services that support this task. Meta-data plays an important role in providing services to retrieve and organise the articles. In such settings, meta-data is rarely explicitly provided, leading to the need for automatically extracting this valuable information. The {TeamBeam} algorithm analyses a scientific article and extracts structured meta-data, such as the title, journal name and abstract, as well as information about the article's authors (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, affiliations). The input of the algorithm is a set of blocks generated from the article text. A classification algorithm, which takes the sequence of the input into account, is then applied in two consecutive phases. In the evaluation of the algorithm, its performance is compared against two heuristics and three existing meta-data extraction systems. Three different data sets with varying characteristics are used to assess the quality of the extraction results. {TeamBeam} performs well under testing and compares favourably with existing approaches.},

News articles are analyzed using domain specific named entity extraction methods combined with language specific heuristics. The proposed methods were subject to an evaluation procedure outlined in this contribution. This article illustrates the domain, the underlying concepts and implementation details. Several visualization modules are presented and an outlook on planned modules is given.

  abstract = {Research papers are published in various digital libraries, which deploy their own meta-models and technologies to manage, query, and analyze scientific facts therein. Commonly they only consider the meta-data provided with each article, but not the contents. Hence, reaching into the contents of publications is inherently a tedious task. On top of that, scientific data within publications are hardcoded in a fixed format (e.g. tables). So, even if one manages to get a glimpse of the data published in digital libraries, it is close to impossible to carry out any analysis on them other than what was intended by the authors. More effective querying and analysis methods are required to better understand scientific facts. In this paper, we present the web-based {CODE} Visualisation Wizard, which provides visual analysis of scientific facts with emphasis on automating the visualisation process, and present an experiment of its application. We also present the entire analytical process and the corresponding tool chain, including components for extraction of scientific data from publications, an easy to use user interface for querying {RDF} knowledge bases, and a tool for semantic annotation of scientific data sets.},

  abstract = {Ontology alignment is the process of mapping related concepts from different ontologies. A lot of research effort has been invested in development of algorithmic methods supporting automatic discovery of mappings between ontological concepts. However, automatic alignment remains potentially prone to errors especially with large real-world ontologies, demanding intervention of domain experts. We therefore created a semi-automatic tool including algorithmic alignment methods and an interactive visual interface. Visualisation components included in the interface support experts in navigating the concept space and reviewing the automatically generated mapping suggestions. An experiment with 15 test users was performed to evaluate whether, and in which cases the use of visualisation is beneficial compared to a user interface employing standard {GUI} widgets. The results indicate that users typically executed tasks slightly faster with an interface using standard widgets, but an interface which includes a visualisation component providing overview, filter and narrowing-down functionality achieved higher rates of successful task completion.},

Secondly, different disjunct query composition techniques to search in the {CLEF} corpus. We apply the same preprocessing steps for the monolingual as well as the crosslingual task and thereby acting fair and in a similar way across these tasks. The evaluation revealed that the similar processing comes at nearly no costs for monolingual retrieval but enables us to do crosslanguage retrieval and also a feasible comparison of our system performance on these two tasks.},

Compared with traditional libraries,meta- data quality is of crucial importance in order to create a crowdsourced bibliographic catalog for search and brows- ing. Artifacts, in particular {PDFs} which are managed by the users of the social research networks, become one im- portant metadata source and the starting point for creating a homogeneous, high quality, bibliographic catalog. Natural Language Processing and Information Extraction techniques have been employed to extract structured information from unstructured sources. However, given highly heterogeneous artifacts that cover a range of publication styles, stemming from different publication sources, and imperfect {PDF} pro- cessing tools, how accurate aremetadata extractionmethods in such real-world settings? This paper focuses on answer- ing that question by investigating the use of Conditional Random Fields and Support Vector Machines on real-world data gathered from Mendeley and Linked-Data repositories. We compare style and content features on existing state-of- the-art methods on two newly created real-world data sets for metadata extraction. Our analysis shows that two-stage {SVMs} provide reasonable performance in solving the chal- lenge ofmetadata extraction for crowdsourcing bibliographic metadata management.},

In this publication we analyse cluster-based disambiguation strategies and develop a model selection method to estimate the number of distinct authors based on co-authorship networks.

  abstract = {The quality and user acceptance of personalized services such as personalized information retrieval and navigation or con- tent recommendation depends depends besides the personal- ization mechanism on the quality, validity and accuracy of the employed user model. In literature a variety of user model construction methods based on tagging activity in social tag- ging systems ({STS}) are presented, relying on different user contexts, e.g., the personal or social context. But up to now there is neither a concise overview of existing construction methods available nor a deeper analysis and discussion of the differences between these models. Such an analysis would for example ease evaluation but also enable system design- ers to choose the most appropriate one. Our work tackles this problem by providing a short overview of state-of-the art user model construction methods which employ social tags. This is followed by a statistical comparison of four different user model construction methods for {STS} based on tag-frequency. This analysis unveils that depending on the method chosen (based user’s personal tagging behavior as well as community- based social strategies), the user model consists of different tags and tag frequency rankings, thus services employing dif- ferent models will lead to different results.},

Usually term weights are determined through statistical estimates based on static weighting schemes. Such static approaches lack the capability to generalize to different domains and different data sets. In this paper, we introduce an on-line learning method for adapting term weights in a supervised manner. Via stochastic optimization we determine a linear transformation of the term space to approximate expected similarity values among documents. We evaluate our approach on 18 standard text data sets and show that the performance improvement of a k-{NN} classifier ranges between 1\% and 12\% by using adaptive term weighting as preprocessing step. Further, we provide empirical evidence that our approach is efficient to cope with larger problems.},

We demonstrate its applicability in scenarios involving data from the Linked Open Data Cloud, and research data extracted from scientific publications. Our focus is on the Web-based front-end consisting of querying and visualisation tools. The performed usability evaluations unveil mainly positive results confirming that the Query Wizard simplifies searching, refining and transforming Linked Data and, in particular, that people using the Visualisation Wizard quickly learn to perform interactive analysis tasks on the resulting Linked Data sets. In making Linked Data analysis effectively accessible to the general public, our tool has been integrated in a number of live services where people use it to analyse, discover and discuss facts with Linked Data.},

For ex- ample, while resources on Delicious are usually tagged by all users who bookmark the web page cnn.com, photos on Flickr are usually tagged just by a single user who uploads the photo. In the literature, this distinction has been described as a distinction between broad vs. narrow folksonomies. This paper sets out to explore navigational differences be- tween broad and narrow folksonomies in social hypertextual systems. We study both kinds of folksonomies on a dataset provided by Mendeley - a collaborative platform where users can annotate and organize scientific articles with tags. Our experiments suggest that broad folksonomies are more use- ful for navigation, and that the collaborative processes that are generating folksonomies matter qualitatively. Our find- ings are relevant for system designers and engineers aiming to improve the navigability of social tagging systems.},

  abstract = {The identification and labeling of non-hierarchical relations are among the most challenging tasks in ontology learning. This paper describes an approach for suggesting ontology relationship types to domain experts based on implicitly learned relations from a domain corpus. The learning process extracts verb- vectors from sentences containing domain concepts. It computes centroids for known relationship types and stores them in the knowledge base. Vectors of unknown relationships are compared to the stored centroids using the cosine similarity metric. The system then suggests the relationship type of the most similar centroid. Domain experts evaluate these suggestions to refine the knowledge base and constantly improve the component's accuracy. Using four sample ontologies on “energy sources”, this paper demonstrates how link type suggestion aids the ontology design process. It also provides a statistical analysis on the accuracy and average ranking performance of batch learning versus online learning.},

While ontologies enable software agents to exchange knowledge and information in a standardised, intelligent manner, describing todays vast amount of information in terms of ontological knowledge and to track the evolution of such ontologies remains a challenge. In this paper we describe Web2.0 crawling for ontology evolution. The World Wide Web, or Web for short, is due, its evolutionary properties and social network characteristics a perfect fitting data source to evolve an ontology. The decentralised structure of the Internet, the huge amount of data and upcoming Web2.0 technologies arise several challenges for a crawling system. In this paper we present a distributed crawling system with standard browser integration. The proposed system is a high performance, sitescript based noise reducing crawler, which loads standard browser equivalent content from Web2.0 resources. Furthermore we describe the integration of this spider into our ontology evolution framework.},

We compare the systems’ accuracy on two newly created real-world data sets gathered from Mendeley and Linked-Open-Data repos- itories.

Comparing verb-vectors extracted from unknown relations with the stored centroids yields link type suggestions. Domain experts evaluate these suggestions, refining the knowledge base and constantly improving the component's accuracy. A final evaluation provides a detailed statistical analysis of the introduced approach.},

  abstract = {An important aspect of a researcher's activities is to find relevant and related publications. The task of a recommender system for scientific publications is to provide a list of papers that match these criteria. Based on the collection of publications managed by Mendeley, four data sets have been assembled that reflect different aspects of relatedness. Each of these relatedness scenarios reflect a user's search strategy. These scenarios are public groups, venues, author publications and user libraries. The first three of these data sets are being made publicly available for other researchers to compare algorithms against. Three recommender systems have been implemented: a collaborative filtering system; a content-based filtering system; and a hybrid of these two systems. Results from testing demonstrate that collaborative filtering slightly outperforms the content-based approach, but fails in some scenarios. The hybrid system, that combines the two recommendation methods, provides the best performance, achieving a precision of up to 70\%. This suggests that both techniques contribute complementary information in the context of recommending scientific literature and different approaches suite for different information needs.},

  title = {Unsupervised document structure analysis of digital scientific articles},
  abstract = {Text mining and information retrieval in large collections of scientific literature require automated processing systems that analyse the documents' content. However, the layout of scientific articles is highly varying across publishers, and common digital document formats are optimised for presentation, but lack structural information. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a processing pipeline that analyses the structure a {PDF} document using a number of unsupervised machine learning techniques and heuristics. Apart from the meta-data extraction, which we reused from previous work, our system uses only information available from the current document and does not require any pre-trained model. First, contiguous text blocks are extracted from the raw character stream. Next, we determine geometrical relations between these blocks, which, together with geometrical and font information, are then used categorize the blocks into different classes. Based on this resulting logical structure we finally extract the body text and the table of contents of a scientific article. We separately evaluate the individual stages of our pipeline on a number of different datasets and compare it with other document structure analysis approaches. We show that it outperforms a state-of-the-art system in terms of the quality of the extracted body text and table of contents. Our unsupervised approach could provide a basis for advanced digital library scenarios that involve diverse and dynamic corpora.},

  abstract = {While Linked Open Data showed enormous increase in volume, yet there is no single point of access for querying the over 200 {SPARQL} repositories. In this paper we present Balloon Fusion, a {SPARQL} 1.1 rewriting and query federation service build on crawling and consolidating co-reference relationships in over 100 reachable Linked Data {SPARQL} Endpoints. The results of this process are 17.6M co-reference statements that have been clustered to 8.4M distinct semantic entities and are now accessible as download for further analysis. The proposed {SPARQL} rewriting performs a substitution of all {URI} occurrences with their synonyms combined with an automatic endpoint selection based on {URI} origin for a comprehensive query federation. While we show the technical feasibility, we also critically reflect the current status of the Linked Open Data cloud: although it is huge in size, access via {SPARQL} Endpoints is complicated in most cases due to missing quality of service.},

The algorithms that demonstrated the best performance for this task come at the price of high computational complexity. In our work we present an algorithm that has a computational complexity of O(n) with n being the number of sentences in a document. The performance of our approach is evaluated against algorithms of higher complexity using standard benchmark data sets and we demonstrate that our approach provides comparable accuracy.},

  abstract = {Large collections of text documents are increasingly common, both in business and personal information environments. Tools from the field of information visualisation are being used to help users make sense of and extract useful knowledge from such collections. Flat text collections are often visualised using distance calculations between documents and subsequent (distance-preserving) projection. Distance calculations are often based on a vector space of term vectors. Projection is often achieved with a force-directed placement algorithm. Where extra information about a text collection is available, such as a topical hierarchy or some chronological ordering, it can be used to improve a visualisation. This paper gives an overview of text mapping techniques.},

For instance, the automated creation of high-quality knowledge bases from clinical reports is important to facilitate decision making processes for clinical doctors. A subtask of creating such structured knowledge is entity disambiguation that establishes links by identifying the correct semantic meaning from a set of candidate meanings to a text fragment. This paper provides a short, concise overview of entity disambiguation in the biomedical domain, with a focus on annotated corpora (e.g. {CalbC}), term disambiguation algorithms (e.g. abbreviation disambiguation) as well as gene and protein disambiguation algorithms (e.g. inter-species gene name disambiguation). Finally, we provide some open problems and future challenges that we expect future research will take into account.},

How- ever, most labeling algorithms ignore such structural prop- erties and therefore, the impact of hierarchical structures on the labeling accuracy is yet unclear. In our work we integrate hierarchical information, i.e. sibling and parent- child relations, in the cluster labeling process. We adapt standard labeling approaches, namely Maximum Term Fre- quency, Jensen-Shannon Divergence, χ2 Test, and Informa- tion Gain, to take use of those relationships and evaluate their impact on 4 different datasets, namely the Open Di- rectory Project, Wikipedia, {TREC} Ohsumed and the {CLEF} {IP} European Patent dataset. We show, that hierarchical relationships can be exploited to increase labeling accuracy especially on high-level nodes.},

The first data source is a snapshot of 50,000 user libraries, enabling researchers to test collaborative filtering algorithms for scientific paper recommendation. The second data source is Mendeleys {API} that provides access to 50 million research articles, crowdsourced from over 1.5 million users. This {API} allows researchers to build third party applications on top of real-time and large scale data. By providing data sources for the study of collaborative filtering, metadata extraction, deduplication and related research, Mendeley hopes to enable researchers in these domains to better collaborate and share knowledge, ultimately encouraging good research practices and advancing the state of scientific knowledge.},

  abstract = {In an interconnected world, Linked Data is more important than ever before. However, it is still quite difficult to access this new wealth of semantic data directly without having in-depth knowledge about {SPARQL} and related semantic technologies. Also, most people are currently used to con- suming data as 2-dimensional tables. Linked Data is by defi- nition always a graph, and not that many people are used to handle data in graph structures. Therefore we present the Linked Data Query Wizard, a web-based tool for displaying, accessing, filtering, exploring, and navigating Linked Data stored in {SPARQL} endpoints. The main innovation of the interface is that it turns the graph structure of Linked Data into a tabular interface and provides easy-to-use interaction possibilities by using metaphors and techniques from current search engines and spreadsheet applications that regular web users are already familiar with.},

  abstract = {Mendeley’s crowd-sourced catalogue of research papers forms the basis of features such as the ability to search for papers, finding papers related to one currently being viewed and per- sonalised recommendations. In order to generate this cat- alogue it is necessary to deduplicate the records uploaded from users’ libraries and imported from external sources such as {PubMed} and {arXiv}. This task has been achieved at Mendeley via an automated system. However the quality of the deduplication needs to be im- proved. “Ground truth” data sets are thus needed for eval- uating the system’s performance but existing datasets are very small. In this paper, the problem of generating large scale data sets from Mendeley’s database is tackled. An approach based purely on random sampling produced very easy data sets so approaches that focus on more difficult ex- amples were explored. We found that selecting duplicates and non duplicates from documents with similar titles pro- duced more challenging datasets. Additionally we estab- lished that a Solr-based deduplication system can achieve a similar deduplication quality to the fingerprint-based sys- tem currently employed. Finally, we introduce a large scale deduplication ground truth dataset that we hope will be useful to others tackling deduplication.},

  abstract = {Support Vector Machines ({SVM}) have been applied successfully in a wide variety of fields in the last decade. The {SVM} problem is formulated as a convex objective function subject to box constraints that needs to be maximized, a quadratic programming ({QP}) problem. In order to solve the {QP} problem on larger data sets specialized algorithms and heuristics are required. In this paper we present a new data-squashing method for selecting training instances in support vector learning. Inspired by the growing neural gas algorithm and learning vector quantization we introduce a new, parameter robust neural gas variant to retrieve an initial approximation of the training set containing only those samples that will likely become support vectors in the final classifier. This first approximation is refined in the border areas, defined by neighboring neurons of different classes, yielding the final training set. We evaluate our approach on synthetic as well as real-life datasets, comparing run-time complexity and accuracy to a random sampling approach and the exact solution of the support vector machine. Results show that runtime-complexity can be significantly reduced while achieving the same accuracy as the exact solution and that furthermore our approach does not not rely on data set specific parameterization of the sampling rate like random sampling for doing so.
