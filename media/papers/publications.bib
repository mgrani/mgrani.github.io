		  source to evolve an ontology. The decentralised structure
		  of the Internet, the huge amount of data and upcoming
		  Web2.0 technologies arise several challenges for a crawling
		  system. In this paper we present a distributed crawling
		  system with standard browser integration. The proposed
		  system is a high performance, sitescript based noise
		  reducing crawler, which loads standard browser equivalent
		  content from Web2.0 resources. Furthermore we describe the
		  integration of this spider into our ontology evolution
		  framework.},

		  relations are among the most challenging tasks in ontology
		  learning. This paper describes an approach for suggesting
		  ontology relationship types to domain experts based on
		  implicitly learned relations from a domain corpus. The
		  learning process extracts verb- vectors from sentences
		  containing domain concepts. It computes centroids for known
		  relationship types and stores them in the knowledge base.
		  Vectors of unknown relationships are compared to the stored
		  centroids using the cosine similarity metric. The system
		  then suggests the relationship type of the most similar
		  centroid. Domain experts evaluate these suggestions to
		  refine the knowledge base and constantly improve the
		  component's accuracy. Using four sample ontologies on
		  ``energy sources'', this paper demonstrates how link type
		  suggestion aids the ontology design process. It also
		  provides a statistical analysis on the accuracy and average
		  ranking performance of batch learning versus online
		  learning.},

		  {CLEF} 2008. Our system is based on query preprocessing for
		  translation and homogenisation of queries. The presented
		  preprocessing of queries includes two stages: Firstly, a
		  query translation step based on term statistics of
		  cooccuring articles in Wikipedia. Secondly, different
		  disjunct query composition techniques to search in the
		  {CLEF} corpus. We apply the same preprocessing steps for
		  the monolingual as well as the crosslingual task and
		  thereby acting fair and in a similar way across these
		  tasks. The evaluation revealed that the similar processing
		  comes at nearly no costs for monolingual retrieval but
		  enables us to do crosslanguage retrieval and also a
		  feasible comparison of our system performance on these two
		  tasks.},

  abstract	= {Support Vector Machines ({SVM}) have been applied
		  successfully in a wide variety of fields in the last
		  decade. The {SVM} problem is formulated as a convex
		  objective function subject to box constraints that needs to
		  be maximized, a quadratic programming ({QP}) problem. In
		  order to solve the {QP} problem on larger data sets
		  specialized algorithms and heuristics are required. In this
		  paper we present a new data-squashing method for selecting
		  training instances in support vector learning. Inspired by
		  the growing neural gas algorithm and learning vector
		  quantization we introduce a new, parameter robust neural
		  gas variant to retrieve an initial approximation of the
		  training set containing only those samples that will likely
		  become support vectors in the final classifier. This first
		  approximation is refined in the border areas, defined by
		  neighboring neurons of different classes, yielding the
		  final training set. We evaluate our approach on synthetic
		  as well as real-life datasets, comparing run-time
		  complexity and accuracy to a random sampling approach and
		  the exact solution of the support vector machine. Results
		  show that runtime-complexity can be significantly reduced
		  while achieving the same accuracy as the exact solution and
		  that furthermore our approach does not not rely on data set
		  specific parameterization of the sampling rate like random
		  sampling for doing so. Source code, binary executables as

  abstract	= {Mendeley's crowd-sourced catalogue of research papers
		  forms the basis of features such as the ability to search
		  for papers, finding papers related to one currently being
		  viewed and per- sonalised recommendations. In order to
		  generate this cat- alogue it is necessary to deduplicate
		  the records uploaded from users' libraries and imported
		  from external sources such as {PubMed} and {arXiv}. This
		  task has been achieved at Mendeley via an automated system.
		  However the quality of the deduplication needs to be im-
		  proved. ``Ground truth'' data sets are thus needed for
		  eval- uating the system's performance but existing datasets
		  are very small. In this paper, the problem of generating
		  large scale data sets from Mendeley's database is tackled.
		  An approach based purely on random sampling produced very
		  easy data sets so approaches that focus on more difficult
		  ex- amples were explored. We found that selecting
		  duplicates and non duplicates from documents with similar
		  titles pro- duced more challenging datasets. Additionally
		  we estab- lished that a Solr-based deduplication system can
		  achieve a similar deduplication quality to the
		  fingerprint-based sys- tem currently employed. Finally, we
		  introduce a large scale deduplication ground truth dataset
		  that we hope will be useful to others tackling
		  deduplication.},

  abstract	= {Although many social tagging systems share a common tri-
		  partite graph structure, the collaborative processes that

		  photos on Flickr are usually tagged just by a single user
		  who uploads the photo. In the literature, this distinction
		  has been described as a distinction between broad vs.

		  navigational differences be- tween broad and narrow
		  folksonomies in social hypertextual systems. We study both
		  kinds of folksonomies on a dataset provided by Mendeley - a
		  collaborative platform where users can annotate and
		  organize scientific articles with tags. Our experiments
		  suggest that broad folksonomies are more use- ful for
		  navigation, and that the collaborative processes that are
		  generating folksonomies matter qualitatively. Our find-
		  ings are relevant for system designers and engineers aiming
		  to improve the navigability of social tagging systems.},

		  literature. Social research networks, such as Mendeley and

		  Meta-data plays an important role in providing services to
		  retrieve and organise the articles. In such settings,
		  meta-data is rarely explicitly provided, leading to the
		  need for automatically extracting this valuable
		  information. The {TeamBeam} algorithm analyses a scientific
		  article and extracts structured meta-data, such as the
		  title, journal name and abstract, as well as information
		  about the article's authors (e.g. names, e-mail addresses,
		  affiliations). The input of the algorithm is a set of
		  blocks generated from the article text. A classification
		  algorithm, which takes the sequence of the input into
		  account, is then applied in two consecutive phases. In the
		  evaluation of the algorithm, its performance is compared
		  against two heuristics and three existing meta-data
		  extraction systems. Three different data sets with varying
		  characteristics are used to assess the quality of the
		  extraction results. {TeamBeam} performs well under testing
		  and compares favourably with existing approaches.},

		  of scientific literature require automated processing
		  systems that analyse the documents' content. However, the

		  publishers, and common digital document formats are
		  optimised for presentation, but lack structural
		  information. To overcome these challenges, we have
		  developed a processing pipeline that analyses the structure
		  a {PDF} document using a number of unsupervised machine
		  learning techniques and heuristics. Apart from the
		  meta-data extraction, which we reused from previous work,
		  our system uses only information available from the current
		  document and does not require any pre-trained model. First,
		  contiguous text blocks are extracted from the raw character
		  stream. Next, we determine geometrical relations between
		  these blocks, which, together with geometrical and font
		  information, are then used categorize the blocks into
		  different classes. Based on this resulting logical
		  structure we finally extract the body text and the table of
		  contents of a scientific article. We separately evaluate
		  the individual stages of our pipeline on a number of
		  different datasets and compare it with other document
		  structure analysis approaches. We show that it outperforms
		  a state-of-the-art system in terms of the quality of the

		  on web page content, there are no specific guidelines of
		  how to design and integrate the additional user interface
		  components. In this paper, we conceptualise related user
		  interface issues, investigating the central questions: (i)
		  how can a user be visually notified that additional results
		  are available, and (ii) with which user interface elements
		  should the results be presented. Concretely, we identified
		  four different notification styles and six different result
		  presentation styles. In a survey-based study with 75
		  participants we elicited the users' preferences, revealing
		  a clear preference for the representation style (split
		  pane) and a strong preference for three notification styles
		  (notification bubble, icon appearance and change of icon's
		  appearance). The latter preferences are related to the
		  preferred browser. The results can serve as guideline for
		  designing web-based user interfaces for just-in-time
		  retrieval.},

  abstract	= {The application of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining
		  approaches forms the basis of realizing the vision of Smart
		  Hospitals. For instance, the automated creation of
		  high-quality knowledge bases from clinical reports is
		  important to facilitate decision making processes for
		  clinical doctors. A subtask of creating such structured
		  knowledge is entity disambiguation that establishes links
		  by identifying the correct semantic meaning from a set of
		  candidate meanings to a text fragment. This paper provides
		  a short, concise overview of entity disambiguation in the
		  biomedical domain, with a focus on annotated corpora (e.g.
		  {CalbC}), term disambiguation algorithms (e.g. abbreviation
		  disambiguation) as well as gene and protein disambiguation
		  algorithms (e.g. inter-species gene name disambiguation).
		  Finally, we provide some open problems and future
		  challenges that we expect future research will take into
		  account.},

A large and growing number of such data cubes is already available in the linked data cloud. Merging multiple isolated cubes can lead to new insights as known from traditional data warehousing. In order to access and integrate the decentralized cubes, a suitable ranking and discovery mechanism is needed. We propose a cube discovery approach, based on the structure definition of the cubes. Syntactic and semantic properties of the cubes are considered to develop a similarity measure for cubes. We present a graph-based shortest-path algorithm that utilizes the DBpedia category dataset and a Word2Vec [2] model, to carry out the discovery process. The structural mapping for the data cubes generated during our ranking process can be leveraged to support the cube integration process. We use a machine learning approach to combine the implemented similarity measures. The evaluation shows, that this combination produces the best results and that the usage of the Hungarian algorithm [3] is suitable to find good structural mappings.},

ABSTRACT = {Embedding social network data into a low-dimensional vector space has shown promising performance for many real-world applications, such as node classification, node clustering, link prediction and network visualization. However, the information contained in these vector embeddings remains abstract and hard to interpret. Methods for inspecting embeddings usually rely on visualization methods, which do not work on a larger scale and do not give concrete interpretations of vector embeddings in terms of preserved network properties (e.g., centrality or betweenness measures). In this paper, we study and investigate network properties preserved by recent random walk-based embedding procedures like node2vec, DeepWalk or LINE. We propose a method that applies learning to rank in order to relate embeddings to network centralities. We evaluate our approach with extensive experiments on real-world and artificial social networks. Experiments show that each embedding method learns different network properties. In addition, we show that our graph embeddings in combination with neural networks provide a computationally efficient way to approximate the Closeness Centrality measure in social networks.},
