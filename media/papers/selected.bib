@Article{	  14kla.gra.jac.ea-Unsupervised-document-structure-analysis,
  abstract	= {Text mining and information retrieval in large collections
		  of scientific literature require automated processing
		  systems that analyse the documents' content. However, the
		  layout of scientific articles is highly varying across
		  publishers, and common digital document formats are
		  optimised for presentation, but lack structural
		  information. To overcome these challenges, we have
		  developed a processing pipeline that analyses the structure
		  a {PDF} document using a number of unsupervised machine
		  learning techniques and heuristics. Apart from the
		  meta-data extraction, which we reused from previous work,
		  our system uses only information available from the current
		  document and does not require any pre-trained model. First,
		  contiguous text blocks are extracted from the raw character
		  stream. Next, we determine geometrical relations between
		  these blocks, which, together with geometrical and font
		  information, are then used categorize the blocks into
		  different classes. Based on this resulting logical
		  structure we finally extract the body text and the table of
		  contents of a scientific article. We separately evaluate
		  the individual stages of our pipeline on a number of
		  different datasets and compare it with other document
		  structure analysis approaches. We show that it outperforms
		  a state-of-the-art system in terms of the quality of the
		  extracted body text and table of contents. Our unsupervised
		  approach could provide a basis for advanced digital library
		  scenarios that involve diverse and dynamic corpora.},

@InProceedings{	  14sab.tsc.vea.ea-Discovery-and-Visual-Analysis,
  abstract	= {Linked Data has grown to become one of the largest
		  available knowledge bases. Unfortunately, this wealth of
		  data remains inaccessible to those without in-depth
		  knowledge of semantic technologies. We describe a toolchain
		  enabling users without semantic technology background to
		  explore and visually analyse Linked Data. We demonstrate
		  its applicability in scenarios involving data from the
		  Linked Open Data Cloud, and research data extracted from
		  scientific publications. Our focus is on the Web-based
		  front-end consisting of querying and visualisation tools.
		  The performed usability evaluations unveil mainly positive
		  results confirming that the Query Wizard simplifies
		  searching, refining and transforming Linked Data and, in
		  particular, that people using the Visualisation Wizard
		  quickly learn to perform interactive analysis tasks on the
		  resulting Linked Data sets. In making Linked Data analysis
		  effectively accessible to the general public, our tool has
		  been integrated in a number of live services where people
		  use it to analyse, discover and discuss facts with Linked
		  Data.},
