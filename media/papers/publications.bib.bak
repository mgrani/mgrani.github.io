For instance, the automated creation of high-quality knowledge bases from clinical reports is important to facilitate decision making processes for clinical doctors. A subtask of creating such structured knowledge is entity disambiguation that establishes links by identifying the correct semantic meaning from a set of candidate meanings to a text fragment. This paper provides a short, concise overview of entity disambiguation in the biomedical domain, with a focus on annotated corpora (e.g. CalbC), term disambiguation algorithms (e.g. abbreviation disambiguation) as well as gene and protein disambiguation algorithms (e.g. inter-species gene name disambiguation). Finally, we provide some open problems and future challenges that we expect future research will take into account.},

This chapter provides an overview of data visualization methods for gaining insight into large, heterogeneous, dynamic textual data sets. We argue that visual analysis, in combination with automatic knowledge discovery methods, provides several advantages. Besides introducing human knowledge and visual pattern recognition into the analytical process, it provides the possibility to improve the performance of automatic methods through user feedback.},

However, it is still quite difficult to access this new wealth of semantic data directly without having in-depth knowledge about SPARQL and related semantic technologies. Also, most people are currently used to con- suming data as 2-dimensional tables. Linked Data is by defi- nition always a graph, and not that many people are used to handle data in graph structures. Therefore we present the Linked Data Query Wizard, a web-based tool for displaying, accessing, filtering, exploring, and navigating Linked Data stored in SPARQL endpoints. The main innovation of the interface is that it turns the graph structure of Linked Data into a tabular interface and provides easy-to-use interaction possibilities by using metaphors and techniques from current search engines and spreadsheet applications that regular web users are already familiar with.},

  Abstract                 = {An important aspect of a researcher's activities is to find relevant and related publications. The task of a recommender system for scientific publications is to provide a list of papers that match these criteria. Based on the collection of publications managed by Mendeley, four data sets have been assembled that reflect different aspects of relatedness. Each of these relatedness scenarios reflect a user's search strategy. These scenarios are public groups, venues, author publications and user libraries. The first three of these data sets are being made publicly available for other researchers to compare algorithms against. Three recommender systems have been implemented: a collaborative filtering system; a content-based filtering system; and a hybrid of these two systems. Results from testing demonstrate that collaborative filtering slightly outperforms the content-based approach, but fails in some scenarios. The hybrid system, that combines the two recommendation methods, provides the best performance, achieving a precision of up to 70\%. This suggests that both techniques contribute complementary information in the context of recommending scientific literature and different approaches suite for different information needs.},

  Abstract                 = {Text mining and information retrieval in large collections of scientific literature require automated processing systems that analyse the documents' content. However, the layout of scientific articles is highly varying across publishers, and common digital document formats are optimised for presentation, but lack structural information. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a processing pipeline that analyses the structure a PDF document using a number of unsupervised machine learning techniques and heuristics. Apart from the meta-data extraction, which we reused from previous work, our system uses only information available from the current document and does not require any pre-trained model. First, contiguous text blocks are extracted from the raw character stream. Next, we determine geometrical relations between these blocks, which, together with geometrical and font information, are then used categorize the blocks into different classes. Based on this resulting logical structure we finally extract the body text and the table of contents of a scientific article. We separately evaluate the individual stages of our pipeline on a number of different datasets and compare it with other document structure analysis approaches. We show that it outperforms a state-of-the-art system in terms of the quality of the extracted body text and table of contents. Our unsupervised approach could provide a basis for advanced digital library scenarios that involve diverse and dynamic corpora.},

  Abstract                 = {Research papers are published in various digital libraries, which deploy their own meta-models and technologies to manage, query, and analyze scientific facts therein. Commonly they only consider the meta-data provided with each article, but not the contents. Hence, reaching into the contents of publications is inherently a tedious task. On top of that, scientific data within publications are hardcoded in a fixed format (e.g. tables). So, even if one manages to get a glimpse of the data published in digital libraries, it is close to impossible to carry out any analysis on them other than what was intended by the authors. More effective querying and analysis methods are required to better understand scientific facts. In this paper, we present the web-based CODE Visualisation Wizard, which provides visual analysis of scientific facts with emphasis on automating the visualisation process, and present an experiment of its application. We also present the entire analytical process and the corresponding tool chain, including components for extraction of scientific data from publications, an easy to use user interface for querying RDF knowledge bases, and a tool for semantic annotation of scientific data sets.},

The results of this process are 17.6M co-reference statements that have been clustered to 8.4M distinct semantic entities and are now accessible as download for further analysis. The proposed SPARQL rewriting performs a substitution of all URI occurrences with their synonyms combined with an automatic endpoint selection based on URI origin for a comprehensive query federation. While we show the technical feasibility, we also critically reflect the current status of the Linked Open Data cloud: although it is huge in size, access via SPARQL Endpoints is complicated in most cases due to missing quality of service.},

The current Linked Open Data cloud, although huge in size, offers poor service quality and is inadequately maintained, thus complicating access via SPARQL endpoints.

We shed light on the corresponding notion of semantically-enhanced information retrieval by presenting state-of-the art techniques in related research areas. We describe techniques based on the main processes of a typical IR workflow and map them onto three main types of semantics, which vary from formal semantic knowledge representations and content-based semantics to social semantics emerging through usage and user interactions.},

Compared with traditional libraries,meta- data quality is of crucial importance in order to create a crowdsourced bibliographic catalog for search and brows- ing. Artifacts, in particular PDFs which are managed by the users of the social research networks, become one im- portant metadata source and the starting point for creating a homogeneous, high quality, bibliographic catalog. Natural Language Processing and Information Extraction techniques have been employed to extract structured information from unstructured sources. However, given highly heterogeneous artifacts that cover a range of publication styles, stemming from different publication sources, and imperfect PDF pro- cessing tools, how accurate aremetadata extractionmethods in such real-world settings? This paper focuses on answer- ing that question by investigating the use of Conditional Random Fields and Support Vector Machines on real-world data gathered from Mendeley and Linked-Data repositories. We compare style and content features on existing state-of- the-art methods on two newly created real-world data sets for metadata extraction.

  Abstract                 = {Mendeley‚Äôs crowd-sourced catalogue of research papers forms the basis of features such as the ability to search for papers, finding papers related to one currently being viewed and per- sonalised recommendations. In order to generate this cat- alogue it is necessary to deduplicate the records uploaded from users‚Äô libraries and imported from external sources such as PubMed and arXiv. This task has been achieved at Mendeley via an automated system. However the quality of the deduplication needs to be im- proved. ‚ÄúGround truth‚Äù data sets are thus needed for eval- uating the system‚Äôs performance but existing datasets are very small. In this paper, the problem of generating large scale data sets from Mendeley‚Äôs database is tackled. An approach based purely on random sampling produced very easy data sets so approaches that focus on more difficult ex- amples were explored. We found that selecting duplicates and non duplicates from documents with similar titles pro- duced more challenging datasets. Additionally we estab- lished that a Solr-based deduplication system can achieve a similar deduplication quality to the fingerprint-based sys- tem currently employed. Finally, we introduce a large scale deduplication ground truth dataset that we hope will be useful to others tackling deduplication.},

  Abstract                 = {Although many social tagging systems share a common tri- partite graph structure, the collaborative processes that are generating these structures can differ significantly. For ex- ample, while resources on Delicious are usually tagged by all users who bookmark the web page cnn.com, photos on Flickr are usually tagged just by a single user who uploads the photo. In the literature, this distinction has been described as a distinction between broad vs. narrow folksonomies. This paper sets out to explore navigational differences be- tween broad and narrow folksonomies in social hypertextual systems. We study both kinds of folksonomies on a dataset provided by Mendeley - a collaborative platform where users can annotate and organize scientific articles with tags. Our experiments suggest that broad folksonomies are more use- ful for navigation, and that the collaborative processes that are generating folksonomies matter qualitatively. Our find- ings are relevant for system designers and engineers aiming to improve the navigability of social tagging systems.},

Social research networks, such as Mendeley and CiteULike, provide services that support this task. Meta-data plays an important role in providing services to retrieve and organise the articles. In such settings, meta-data is rarely explicitly provided, leading to the need for automatically extracting this valuable information. The TeamBeam algorithm analyses a scientific article and extracts structured meta-data, such as the title, journal name and abstract, as well as information about the article's authors (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, affiliations). The input of the algorithm is a set of blocks generated from the article text. A classification algorithm, which takes the sequence of the input into account, is then applied in two consecutive phases. In the evaluation of the algorithm, its performance is compared against two heuristics and three existing meta-data extraction systems. Three different data sets with varying characteristics are used to assess the quality of the extraction results. TeamBeam performs well under testing and compares favourably with existing approaches.},

Our preliminary find- ings indicate that the analysis of user library statistics can produce accurate, timely, and content-rich results. We find that there is a significant relationship between the impact factor and the occurrence of references in libraries.

  Abstract                 = {Ontology alignment is the process of mapping related concepts from different ontologies. A lot of research effort has been invested in development of algorithmic methods supporting automatic discovery of mappings between ontological concepts. However, automatic alignment remains potentially prone to errors especially with large real-world ontologies, demanding intervention of domain experts. We therefore created a semi-automatic tool including algorithmic alignment methods and an interactive visual interface. Visualisation components included in the interface support experts in navigating the concept space and reviewing the automatically generated mapping suggestions. An experiment with 15 test users was performed to evaluate whether, and in which cases the use of visualisation is beneficial compared to a user interface employing standard GUI widgets. The results indicate that users typically executed tasks slightly faster with an interface using standard widgets, but an interface which includes a visualisation component providing overview, filter and narrowing-down functionality achieved higher rates of successful task completion.},

In literature a variety of user model construction methods based on tagging activity in social tag- ging systems (STS) are presented, relying on different user contexts, e.g., the personal or social context. But up to now there is neither a concise overview of existing construction methods available nor a deeper analysis and discussion of the differences between these models. Such an analysis would for example ease evaluation but also enable system design- ers to choose the most appropriate one. Our work tackles this problem by providing a short overview of state-of-the art user model construction methods which employ social tags. This is followed by a statistical comparison of four different user model construction methods for STS based on tag-frequency. This analysis unveils that depending on the method chosen (based user‚Äôs personal tagging behavior as well as community- based social strategies), the user model consists of different tags and tag frequency rankings, thus services employing dif- ferent models will lead to different results.},

Automatic disambiguation algorithms mostly rely on cluster-based disam- biguation strategies for identifying unique authors given their names and publications. However, most approaches rely on knowing the correct number of unique authors a-priori, which is rarely the case in real world settings. In this publication we analyse cluster-based disambiguation strategies and develop a model selection method to estimate the number of distinct authors based on co-authorship networks. We show that, given clean textual features, the developed model selection method provides accurate guesses of the number of unique authors.},

 are determined through statistical estimates based on static weighting schemes. Such static approaches lack the capability
 to generalize to different domains and different data sets. In this paper, we introduce an on-line learning method for adapting
 term weights in a supervised manner. Via stochastic optimization we determine a linear transformation of the term space to
 approximate expected similarity values among documents. We evaluate our approach on 18 standard text data sets and show that
 the performance improvement of a k-NN classifier ranges between 1\% and 12\% by using adaptive term weighting as preprocessing
 step. Further, we provide empirical evidence that our approach is efficient to cope with larger problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Cluster label quality is crucial for browsing topic hierarchies obtained via document clustering. Intuitively, the hierarchi- cal structure should influence the labeling accuracy. How- ever, most labeling algorithms ignore such structural prop- erties and therefore, the impact of hierarchical structures on the labeling accuracy is yet unclear. In our work we integrate hierarchical information, i.e. sibling and parent- child relations, in the cluster labeling process. We adapt standard labeling approaches, namely Maximum Term Fre- quency, Jensen-Shannon Divergence, $\chi$2 Test, and Informa- tion Gain, to take use of those relationships and evaluate their impact on 4 different datasets, namely the Open Di- rectory Project, Wikipedia, TREC Ohsumed and the CLEF IP European Patent dataset. We show, that hierarchical relationships can be exploited to increase labeling accuracy especially on high-level nodes.},

KnowMiner is a service oriented framework providing a rich set of knowledge discovery functionalities with focus on text data sets. Complementing results of automatic machine analysis with the immense processing power of human visual apparatus has the potential of significantly improving the process of acquiring new knowledge. VisTools is a lightweight visual analytics framework based on multiple coordinated views (MCV) paradigm designed for deployment atop the KnowMiner‚Äôs service architecture. In this paper we briefly present both frameworks and, driven by real-world customer requirements, describe how visual techniques can be synergistically combined with machine processing for effective analysis of dynamically changing, metadata-rich text documents sets.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present the methodology, implementations and evaluation results of the crosslanguage retrieval system we
 have developed for the Robust WSD Task at CLEF 2008. Our system is based on query preprocessing for translation and homogenisation
 of queries. The presented preprocessing of queries includes two stages: Firstly, a query translation step based on term statistics
 of cooccuring articles in Wikipedia. Secondly, different disjunct query composition techniques to search in the CLEF corpus.
 We apply the same preprocessing steps for the monolingual as well as the crosslingual task and thereby acting fair and in
 a similar way across these tasks. The evaluation revealed that the similar processing comes at nearly no costs for monolingual
 retrieval but enables us to do crosslanguage retrieval and also a feasible comparison of our system performance on these two
 tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been applied successfully in a wide variety of fields in the last decade. The SVM problem
 is formulated as a convex objective function subject to box constraints that needs to be maximized, a quadratic programming
 (QP) problem. In order to solve the QP problem on larger data sets specialized algorithms and heuristics are required. In
 this paper we present a new data-squashing method for selecting training instances in support vector learning. Inspired by
 the growing neural gas algorithm and learning vector quantization we introduce a new, parameter robust neural gas variant
 to retrieve an initial approximation of the training set containing only those samples that will likely become support vectors
 in the final classifier. This first approximation is refined in the border areas, defined by neighboring neurons of different
 classes, yielding the final training set. We evaluate our approach on synthetic as well as real-life datasets, comparing run-time
 complexity and accuracy to a random sampling approach and the exact solution of the support vector machine. Results show that
 runtime-complexity can be significantly reduced while achieving the same accuracy as the exact solution and that furthermore
 our approach does not not rely on data set specific parameterization of the sampling rate like random sampling for doing so.

Tools from the field of information visualisation are being used to help users make sense of and extract useful knowledge from such collections. Flat text collections are often visualised using distance calculations between documents and subsequent (distance-preserving) projection. Distance calculations are often based on a vector space of term vectors. Projection is often achieved with a force-directed placement algorithm. Where extra information about a text collection is available, such as a topical hierarchy or some chronological ordering, it can be used to improve a visualisation. This paper gives an overview of text mapping techniques.},

The proposed methods were subject to an evaluation procedure outlined in this contribution. This article illustrates the domain, the underlying concepts and implementation details. Several visualization modules are presented and an outlook on planned modules is given. Being online for around six months the community feedback as well as the easy integration of new modules shows the success of the underlying concept and the platform itself.},

Recent trends in social and collaborative software have greatly increased the popularity of this type of visualization. This paper proposes a family of novel algorithms for tag cloud layout and presents evaluation results obtained from an extensive user study and a technical evaluation. The algorithms address issues found in many common approaches, for example large whitespaces, overlapping tags and restriction to specific boundaries. The layouts computed by these algorithms are compact and clear, have small whitespaces and may feature arbitrary convex polygons as boundaries. The results of the user study and the technical evaluation enable designers to devise a combination of algorithm and parameters which produces satisfying tag cloud layouts for many application scenarios.},

  Abstract                 = {Semantic Web technologies in general and ontologybased approaches in particular are considered the foundation for the next generation of information services. While ontologies enable software agents to exchange knowledge and information in a standardised, intelligent manner, describing todays vast amount of information in terms of ontological knowledge and to track the evolution of such ontologies remains a challenge. In this paper we describe Web2.0 crawling for ontology evolution. The World Wide Web, or Web for short, is due, its evolutionary properties and social network characteristics a perfect fitting data source to evolve an ontology. The decentralised structure of the Internet, the huge amount of data and upcoming Web2.0 technologies arise several challenges for a crawling system. In this paper we present a distributed crawling system with standard browser integration. The proposed system is a high performance, sitescript based noise reducing crawler, which loads standard browser equivalent content from Web2.0 resources. Furthermore we describe the integration of this spider into our ontology evolution framework.},

  Abstract                 = {The identification and labeling of non-hierarchical relations are among the most challenging tasks in ontology learning. This paper describes an approach for suggesting ontology relationship types to domain experts based on implicitly learned relations from a domain corpus. The learning process extracts verb- vectors from sentences containing domain concepts. It computes centroids for known relationship types and stores them in the knowledge base. Vectors of unknown relationships are compared to the stored centroids using the cosine similarity metric. The system then suggests the relationship type of the most similar centroid. Domain experts evaluate these suggestions to refine the knowledge base and constantly improve the component's accuracy. Using four sample ontologies on ``energy sources'', this paper demonstrates how link type suggestion aids the ontology design process. It also provides a statistical analysis on the accuracy and average ranking performance of batch learning versus online learning.},
